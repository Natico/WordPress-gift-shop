You can now easily duplicate a product from your editor. Just install this plugin, and click on the right hand side "duplicate" link. You can also use bulk actions to duplicate multiple products.

**PLEASE NOTE:** you must be using WooCommerce with the plugin.

If you something doesn't work, as a complimentary service, I can have a quick look. Go to [WPGem.com](https://WPGem.com) if you need further help.

Note there are three other ways to duplicate products, using this plugin.

1)  Besides the link, you can also tick the checkbox next to a selection of products. Then from "Bulk actions" above the product list, select "Duplicate product." Click "Apply."

2) Another way is to click on the "Edit" link. Then, you should see a box with options to duplicate the product once or multiple times.

3) Yet still, you should see the "Duplicate this product" link in the admin bar when you are editing the product.

Let me know how things go or if you need further assistance.
